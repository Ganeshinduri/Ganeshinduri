Hi @Ganeshinduri! It's great to see your interest in coding, robotics, designing, and CNC VMC programming. 
Learning Python, Java, and JavaScript is a fantastic step in the right direction. 
These languages have wide applications in software development and can be useful in various domains, including robotics and CNC programming.

Regarding collaboration with TCS (Tata Consultancy Services), it's advisable to directly reach out to their recruitment or hiring departments.
They usually have official channels for job applications, internships, or collaborations.

If you have any specific questions or need assistance with coding, robotics, or programming, feel free to ask. I'm here to help!
